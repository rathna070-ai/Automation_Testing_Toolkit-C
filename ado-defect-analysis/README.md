# ADO Defect LLM Analysis

Pulls closed defects out of Azure DevOps, has an LLM classify root cause and flag
testing gaps, aggregates the results, and exports them for Power BI (or a standalone
Streamlit dashboard) — the "AI does judgment, human/BI tool does presentation"
companion to the Web Test Toolkit in this repo.

See [docs/PHASE-PLAN.md](docs/PHASE-PLAN.md) for what each phase does and its
current status.

## Setup

```bash
cd ado-defect-analysis
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

cp .env.example .env
# fill in ADO_ORGANIZATION / ADO_PROJECT / ADO_PAT and GROQ_API_KEY
```

## Run it

```bash
# one defect-analysis pass end to end
python -m ado_defect_analysis.cli run-all

# or step by step
python -m ado_defect_analysis.cli fetch
python -m ado_defect_analysis.cli categorize
python -m ado_defect_analysis.cli report
python -m ado_defect_analysis.cli export

# optional standalone dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```

Output lands in `data/`: `defects.db` (SQLite — raw pull + categorizations) and
`exports/` (`categorized_defects.csv`/`.xlsx`, `narrative_summary.json`). Both are
gitignored; regenerate them by re-running the pipeline.

## Getting defects in: ADO API or an Excel export

Two ways to populate `defects.db` — pick whichever matches what access you actually have:

**Direct API** (`fetch`, no flag) — needs `ADO_ORGANIZATION`, `ADO_PROJECT`, `ADO_PAT`
in `.env`. Queries ADO's WIQL endpoint for closed/resolved/done work items, then
batch-fetches fields for each. Comment threads are *not* pulled by default (ADO has
no batch endpoint for comments — it's one REST call per work item); set
`ADO_FETCH_COMMENTS=true` to turn that on if you want them and can afford the extra
calls.

**Excel/CSV import** (`fetch --from-excel PATH`) — no PAT, no API access, no
`ADO_ORGANIZATION`/`ADO_PROJECT` needed at all. Point it at a file exported from ADO
by hand (a query's "Open in Microsoft Excel," or "Export to CSV"):

```bash
python -m ado_defect_analysis.cli fetch --from-excel path/to/defects_export.xlsx
# or run the whole pipeline against the export in one shot
python -m ado_defect_analysis.cli run-all --from-excel path/to/defects_export.xlsx
```

Column headers are matched case-insensitively against both the display name ADO
shows in the UI ("Title", "Area Path", "Tags") and the raw field reference name
("System.Title", "System.AreaPath", "System.Tags") — a typical export just works.
Include a **Tags** and a **Comments** column in the export (add them to the query's
column options before exporting) and both flow into the categorization prompt as
extra signal, the same as the API path's `ADO_FETCH_COMMENTS=true` would give you,
at zero extra API cost. Only `ID` and `Title` are required; everything else is
optional and defaults to blank if the column isn't present. If your export uses
unusual header names, pass a `column_map` to `parse_excel()`
(`src/ado_defect_analysis/excel_source.py`) rather than renaming the sheet.

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```

All tests run offline — the Groq HTTP layer is mocked (`responses`), and the LLM
pipeline stages take an injectable `LlmProvider`, so no API key is needed to run
the suite.

## LLM provider: Groq today, Copilot as a placeholder

`LLM_PROVIDER` in `.env` picks the backend. Every pipeline stage codes against the
`LlmProvider` interface (`src/ado_defect_analysis/llm/base.py`) — it never imports
Groq or Copilot directly — so switching providers is a config change:

- `LLM_PROVIDER=groq` (default) — implemented, calls Groq's OpenAI-compatible chat
  completions API. Needs `GROQ_API_KEY`.
- `LLM_PROVIDER=copilot` — a placeholder for a future GitHub Copilot / GitHub Models
  integration (`llm/copilot_provider.py`). It's wired into the factory and `Config`
  already has `COPILOT_API_KEY`/`COPILOT_MODEL` fields, but `complete_json` currently
  raises `LlmProviderError` explaining it isn't implemented yet. When Copilot exposes
  a usable inference endpoint, that one class is what needs writing — no other file
  in the pipeline changes.
