"""Phase 1: get closed defects into SQLite, from Azure DevOps directly or
from a hand-exported Excel/CSV extract.

Two entrypoints, one storage step: `run_fetch` talks to the ADO REST API
(needs ADO_ORGANIZATION/ADO_PROJECT/ADO_PAT); `run_fetch_from_excel` reads a
local file someone exported from ADO themselves and needs no ADO credentials
at all. Both end by calling `DefectStore.upsert_defects`, so `categorize`,
`report`, and `export` don't know or care which path a defect came in
through.
